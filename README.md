# Next.js (React) ServerSideRendering
ZTM SSR Project

Basic Project with react and next js that does server side renddering.

I used jsonplaceholder.com/users to populate a list of 'robot' details, grabbed the name of each 'robot' and got an image from Robofriends, I then dynamically create pages for all the 'robots' so that when you click on one of the 'robots' it takes you to a dynamically generated page with the rebot details and their location from coords that I get from the jsonplaceholder.com/users api where each user has a geo location as part of their object, then used a little library called Leaflet to get a small map displayed on the robot/id page of each robot which is dynamically generated.

Thank you to the guys who created robohash, jsonplaceholder and leaflet for the awesome tools you created for us as developers to learn and grow with.
